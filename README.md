## Walkthrough

- Create a PostgreSQL database in [railway.app/new](https://railway.app/new)
- Go to the DB's Variables tab and copy it's DATABASE_URL
- Paste the URL in the .env.example file. Rename to .env
- The schema.prisma file, takes care of connecting to the database, setting up a Prisma client, and modelling all your data.
- Run _npx prisma db push_ to push the schema to the DB
- Within the lib folder, create a prisma.ts file. In this file, you'll pass the Prisma client to your entire app as a global variable.
- Connect Prisma to NextAuth
- Connect NextAuth to a [new GitHub Application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
- Use the application's ClientID and Client Secret in the .env.
- Generate a random openssl key for the .env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- In the Navbar's Sign In button, import and use { signIn, signOut } from "next-auth/react";
- Verify the user was added to the Postgre DB with _npx prisma studio_
- Create a wrapper for the Navbar called Nav. It will be responsible for retrieving the server session from next-auth and pass it on to Navbar.
- Add Props to the Navbar using next-auth's Session object.
- Create a protected route to the /analytics page. Create a folder called analytics - Next.js will create the route - and a page.tsx file inside.
- use getServerSession() to check for a logged in user. If !session, redirect to "api/auth/signin", else, return <Analytics />
- Create the Analytics page. We'll use Tremor to build graphs and charts, using mock data provided with the starter app, available at each controller.
- Create the Users table. Fetch the data uing the Prisma client
- Create the Searchbar
